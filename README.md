TURRPG 2
========
TURRPG 2 is a fork of [TitanRPG](https://github.com/pdinklag/TitanRPG) for the Tony's Unreal Realm UT2k4 server.

Building
--------
TURRPG 2 can be built like any other UT2004 package. The following steps are necessary:

* Clone the repository into your UT2004 installation directory (so that the TURRPG2 directory is on the same level as e.g. *System* or *Animations*).
* Add `OnslaughtBP` and `TURRPG2` to the `EditPackages` list in your `UT2004.ini` file.
* Switch to your installation's `System` directory.
* Remove any existing `TURRPG2.u` file.
* Execute the command line `ucc make`.

Documentation State
-------------------
There is currently no documentation for configuring TURRPG 2 and none is planned.
